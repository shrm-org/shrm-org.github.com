Note this isn't quite the S5 "default" theme.  
This is the S5 default theme directory with the "railscast" theme laid on top of it.  
That was easier to set up than trying to figure out how to get pandoc to point to something other than "s5/default" when given "-t s5 --standalone".
(Besides, the S5 default is pretty ugly, so I'm not sure we'd ever want to use it anyway.)
